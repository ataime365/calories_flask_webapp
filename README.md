This project is built with Flask web framework, Requests Library and Python.

It calculates the calories a person would need in a day, based on the climate(temperature) conditions of the persons surrounding

It uses requests to extract the temperature from https://www.timeanddate.com/weather/ and then uses selectorlib through the xpath in the .yaml file to extract the temprature value.
